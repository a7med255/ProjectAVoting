🚀 Excited to share my latest mini-project: Voting System 🎉

As a backend developer, I worked on building the logic and infrastructure for this system that allows users to vote for their choice of admin. The admin panel supports edit, delete, and add functionalities for admins and persons. Key features include:

🔄 Admin voting system with full management controls.
👤 Person management for easy record updates.
⚙️ Developed using ASP.NET Core MVC with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and a template for the front-end.
Check out the full project on GitHub: ProjectAVoting

This project was a great way to deepen my backend expertise and work on integrating systems for seamless user experience.
